Main takeaways:

Part 1:
- Dijkstra-inspired shortest path algorithm using a binary heap;
- Binary heap implementation in C using an array;
- Set implementation in C: the set is just a matrix with coordinates for each tile in the maze. As a way of packing information into the set, each of the 4 least significant bits represents a different facing direction.

Part 2:
- Tracking shortest paths and backtracking them at the end;
- Chained hash map implementation using an arena for memory allocation in C.
