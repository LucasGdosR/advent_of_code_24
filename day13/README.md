Main takeaways:

Part 1 (in Python):
- The "computer science" way to solve this problem is by dynamic programming. I implemented recursive backtracking with memoization in the Python version;
- In the C version, I went straight to the linear algebra solution. In it, I actually solved the linear system and put the solution in the code instead of coding up a linear system solver.

Part 2:
- The inputs got too big, so this should instead be solved by mathematics. This is a linear system, and the implentation solves the linear system using linear algebra instead of search.
