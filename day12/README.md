Part 1:
- Graph search finding components;
- Calculating the perimeter of a graph.
Part 2:
- This was the first hard problem in this year's edition. Implementing the solution is easy, but realizing that in order to count sides, you should count corners, and that to count corners, you should look for indexes that appear an odd number of times, is tricky. The edge cases of corners that look like they touch, but don't, add another tricky detail.
