Main takeaways:
1. Part 1:
- Implementation of a dependency graph traversed in depth-first order, fulfilling all dependencies in a single pass;
- C: neat way to use structs to more easily parse input;
- C: using fixed length strings as an index into an array;
- C: using negative numbers as a sort of set.
2. Part 2:
- Visualization to aid in fixing the circuit. In this image, these are swapped:
  - dwp <=> kfm
  - z22 <=> gjh
  - z08 <=> ffj
  - z31 <=> jdr
