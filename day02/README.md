Main takeaways:
1. Part 1:
-  Know your data: see day 01;
-  Tokenization implementation;
-  Zero is initialization: use 0 as a valid input and possible sentinel. The length of the actual input is variable in this problem, and always positive. Zero in `reports` means the actual input is over without storing bounds information.
2. Part 2:
- Combinatorics implementation.
