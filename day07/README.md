Main takeaways:
- Implementation of arrays that know their bounds in C (store the length in the header (i.e. first element));
- In place recursive backtracking implementation with no additional memory usage;
- Functional one liner in python (`if` is filter, `t for t, o in e.items()` is map, `sum` is reduce).
