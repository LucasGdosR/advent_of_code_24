Main takeaways:

Part 1:
- The "computer science" way to solve this problem is by dynamic programming. I implemented recursive backtracking with memoization.

Part 2:
- The inputs got too big, so this should instead be solved by mathematics. This is a linear system, and the implentation solves the linear system using linear algebra instead of search.
