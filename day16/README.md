Main takeaways:

Part 1:
- Dijkstra-inspired shortest path algorithm using a binary heap;
- Binary heap implementation in C;
- Weird set implementation in C: concatenating 2 8-bit numbers creates the index (the "hash function"), and the value has one bit for each direction. This is fun, but likely a waste of memory.

Part 2:
- Tracking shortest paths and backtracking them at the end.
